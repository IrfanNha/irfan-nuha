## *Shadows of Betrayal*

*Fare thee well, thou heart of stone,<br>*  
*If thy wish is for me to depart,<br>*  
*I shall fade as mist in the sunlit morn,<br>*  
*No trace of mine shall linger in thy heart.<br>*  

*Thy orchard bore naught but poisoned fruit,<br>*  
*Each sweetened word but a lie in disguise.<br>*  
*I feasted once, then found the root,<br>*  
*Where betrayal bloomed beneath thy guise.<br>*  

*I thank thee still for wounds unkind,<br>*  
*Each scar a mark of thy cruel art.<br>*  
*In the ruins of love, no peace I find,<br>*  
*For thou hast torn asunder my heart.<br>*  

*Farewell, O bane of my fleeting days,<br>*  
*May thy storms rage fierce, thy skies remain gray.<br>*  
*Yet know this truth: though I loathe thy face,<br>*  
*I loved thee once, now regret takes its place.<br>*
