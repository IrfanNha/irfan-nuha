## *Shadows of Betrayal*

*Fare thee well, thou heart of stone,*
*If thy wish is for me to depart,*
*I shall fade as mist in the sunlit morn,*  
*No trace of mine shall linger in thy heart.*

*Thy orchard bore naught but poisoned fruit,*  
*Each sweetened word but a lie in disguise.*  
*I feasted once, then found the root,*  
*Where betrayal bloomed beneath thy guise.*

*I thank thee still for wounds unkind,*  
*Each scar a mark of thy cruel art.*  
*In the ruins of love, no peace I find,*  
*For thou hast torn asunder my heart.*

*Farewell, O bane of my fleeting days,*  
*May thy storms rage fierce, thy skies remain gray.*  
*Yet know this truth: though I loathe thy face,*  
*I loved thee once, now regret takes its place.*
